# Convertible

Converting your basic types and models to-and-from JSON, binary data, etc. is a common task in application development. `Convertible` defines a collection of Swift protocols and implementations that makes the conversion process easy, so you don't have to write boilerplate code.

## Installation

`Convertible` is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install, simply include the following lines in your podfile:

pod 'Convertible'
```
Be sure to import the module at the top of your .swift files:
